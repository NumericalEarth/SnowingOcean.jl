# # Melting beneath an ice lid (2D)
#
# This example illustrates the `SnowingOcean` ice–ocean melt interface on a simple
# two-dimensional (``x``–``z``) problem: a slab of ice floating over warm, salty water.
# Heat carried to the ice base melts it; the cold, fresh meltwater forms a buoyant
# boundary layer beneath the ice. It is a stripped-down version of the ice-shelf cavity
# setup — flat ice, no sill, no rotation — meant to show the user interface.
#
# ## The melt parameterization
#
# At the ice–ocean interface the temperature ``T_b``, salinity ``S_b`` and melt rate
# ``\dot m`` (m s⁻¹, positive for melting) are determined by a turbulent heat balance, a
# salt balance, and the requirement that the interface sits at the local freezing point
# (the **three-equation** formulation of Holland & Jenkins, 1999):
#
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \rho_o c_o \, \gamma_T \,(T - T_b) &= \rho_i L \, \dot m , \\
# \rho_o \, \gamma_S \,(S - S_b)     &= \rho_i \, \dot m \, S_b , \\
# T_b &= T^f(S_b, z) = T_0 - \Gamma S_b + \lambda z .
# \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# Here ``\gamma_T = \Gamma_T u_\star`` and ``\gamma_S = \Gamma_S u_\star`` are turbulent
# exchange velocities, ``u_\star = \sqrt{C_d \, |\mathbf{u}|^2}`` is the friction velocity,
# and ``T^f`` is the (depth-dependent, linear) freezing temperature. Because the liquidus
# is linear, the system reduces to a **closed-form quadratic** for ``S_b`` — no iteration.
# The **two-equation** formulation ([`TwoEquation`](@ref)) instead sets ``S_b = S`` and
# obtains ``\dot m`` directly from the heat balance.
#
# `SnowingOcean` computes the kinematic boundary fluxes ``J^T = -\gamma_T (T - T_b)`` and
# ``J^S = -\gamma_S (S - S_b)`` into `Field`s (in a callback), and applies them as flux
# boundary conditions on the immersed ice base — with the *same* drag coefficient ``C_d``
# used for the momentum `BulkDrag`, so the melt and momentum fluxes are consistent.

# ## Grid and immersed ice lid
#
# A 2D `x`–`z` domain (`Flat` in `y`). The ice occupies the top `ice_thickness` meters;
# everything below is ocean. Increasing the `y` size turns this into a 3D simulation.

# ## The ice–ocean interface and boundary conditions
#
# `IceOceanInterface` allocates the flux `Field`s and stores the melt/drag parameters;
# `ice_ocean_boundary_conditions` builds the `(u, v, T, S)` boundary conditions that read
# them on the immersed ice base. The default `formulation = ThreeEquation()` uses constant
# transfer coefficients; pass `formulation = MoninObukhovNearWall()` instead for the
# wall-model closure of Vreugdenhil et al. (2022), which computes the friction velocity and
# transfer coefficients self-consistently with the near-wall stratification.

# ## Model
#
# A non-hydrostatic model with a linear equation of state, so the cold/fresh meltwater
# layer is buoyant relative to the warm, salty interior. We use a
# `ConjugateGradientPoissonSolver`: the default FFT-based pressure solver is only
# approximate next to immersed boundaries and would leave the velocity divergent at the
# ice base, so it is the appropriate choice whenever the ice is an immersed boundary.
